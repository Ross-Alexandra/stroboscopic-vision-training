## ⚠️ Epilepsy Warning
This program uses rapidly flashing visual stimuli designed for stroboscopic vision training. Flashing lights and patterns may trigger seizures in individuals with photosensitive epilepsy, even if they have never experienced a seizure before.

By using this software, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

    You are using it at your own risk.

    You do not have a known history of photosensitive epilepsy or related neurological conditions.

    You have ensured that others in the room are not exposed to the strobing display, especially individuals who may be vulnerable.

    If you experience any symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, disorientation, visual disturbances, or seizures, stop immediately and consult a medical professional.

To reduce risk:

    Use the program in a well-lit room.

    Sit an appropriate distance from the monitor.

    Do not use if you are tired or sleep-deprived.

If you're distributing the tool, you might also consider requiring users to acknowledge this warning on first launch, or displaying it for a few seconds before enabling the overlay.
